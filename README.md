# Python Pickle RCE Exploit (Windows Modified)

A simple RCE Pickle PoC with a vulnerable Flask App, modified for Windows.

In Python, the pickle module lets you serialize and deserialize data. Essentially, this means that you can convert a Python object into a stream of bytes and then reconstruct it (including the objectâ€™s internal structure) later in a different process or environment by loading that stream of bytes (for further info checkout this: [Exploiting Python Pickle](https://davidhamann.de/2020/04/05/exploiting-python-pickle/)).

## Deserialization Attacks

In addition to understanding how to set up the vulnerable Flask app and exploit the Pickle RCE vulnerability, it's crucial to be aware of deserialization attacks. Deserialization attacks occur when vulnerabilities in the deserialization process of an application are exploited to execute arbitrary code or manipulate data. In Python, the pickle module, commonly used for serialization and deserialization, can be susceptible to such attacks if not handled securely. Attackers can craft malicious pickle payloads that, when deserialized by a vulnerable application, lead to the execution of unauthorized code. These attacks can have severe consequences, including remote code execution, data manipulation, or even complete system compromise. Therefore, developers should implement robust input validation, employ secure deserialization practices, and adhere to least privilege principles to mitigate the risk of deserialization attacks in their applications.

## Setting up vulnerable Flask app (app.py)

To set up the vulnerable Flask app on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Install Flask:

   ```
   $ pip install Flask
   ```

2. Run the Flask app:
   ```
   $ python app.py
   ```

## Exploit Pickle RCE (Pickle-PoC.py)

To exploit the Pickle RCE vulnerability on Windows, you can use the provided Python script:

$ python Pickle-PoC.py [URL]

Replace `[URL]` with the URL of the vulnerable Flask app's endpoint.

## Exploit Pickle RCE PoC for THM Owasp10 Room (THM_pickle_owasp10_room.py)

For the Pickle RCE PoC in the THM Owasp10 Room on Windows, you can use the provided Python script:

$ python THM_pickle_owasp10_room.py
This script exploits the Pickle RCE vulnerability for the THM Owasp10 Room.
